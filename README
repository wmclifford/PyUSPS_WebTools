PyUSPS_WebTools

README
================================================================================

This library is designed to provide a simple, elegant interface to the web tools
API provided by the United States Postal Service (USPS). After developing an
interface for a client of mine, I decided to expand upon that interface and make
a more generic, open-source version of the library. I didn't realize at the time
that a Perl-based implementation had already been written (not much Perl
development being done here), however I had not come across a Python
implementation as of yet, so here we go. :)

Initially, the library will provide access to the address info, delivery
confirmation, and tracking confirmation services. When and if others are needed,
I will add them into the library as well. For now, however, the library is to
be considered in flux until stated otherwise on the project Wiki.

Development Environment:
    *   Python 2.6.4
    *   Ubuntu Linux / Windows XP (depends what machine I happen to be at)
    *   git version control system
    *   Komodo Edit 5.2

Contributions to this project are welcome and will be reviewed before added to
the codebase.
